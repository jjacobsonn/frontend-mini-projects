## Technical Overview

This project is a static registration form built with HTML and CSS:

1. **HTML Structure**: The form is organized into two main sections using `<fieldset>`. The first collects personal information (name, address, zip, phone, email). The second collects information on how the user found the page, using checkboxes for multiple options.
2. **CSS Styling**: The form is centered on the page with a dark background, white text, and clear input fields. Responsive design ensures usability on all devices. Inputs and buttons are styled for clarity and accessibility.
3. **Accessibility**: All fields use `<label>` elements for better screen reader support and usability. Required fields enforce user input before submission.

This project demonstrates best practices for building accessible, user-friendly forms with modern HTML and CSS.
